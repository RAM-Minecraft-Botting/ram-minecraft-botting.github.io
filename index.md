RAM Botting is a group about discussing botting in Minecraft. We primarially operate out of a Discord server (you can find the link in the sidebar) but this website contains resources about techniques used in botting, tutorials for writing your first bot, and the source code of many bots. 

About
---

We created our discord server because of the lack of many resources for botting in the unique ruleset of Civservers. Civservers, in addition to the block protection mechanics through the Citedel plugin, tend to impose a very unique rule upon bots, if they allow botting at all: Your bot can not read the outside enviroment. You can only read your health, hunger, your bot's coordinates, and chat. This restriction makes most bots built for minecraft useless, and as a result, most bots were closed-source and costed a large number of diamonds or out of game money. Our discord server acts as a central forum for discussion of botting, and to answer questions people have about botting, and to encourage the creation of open-source bots that are freely available.

Our name origanates from the most common thing we do: Rant(ing) About Macromod. Macromod is a mod that implements a simple way to create a bot in minecraft. It is an easily installable forge mod, and you can get started with it with very little effort. However, the language you create bots in is rittled with idiosyncrasies and unexpected points. Comments are just a hack in the syntax highlighter, macromod ignores anything it doesn't parse, macromod executes code inside comments, decimal numbers are not implemented, and so on. Rants about macromod are something you can fill a book with, and we plan to. Instead, we're putting that effort to use. At least two of our members are working on a replacement to macromod specalized to our purposes, and we have knowlege in a number of existing replacements.
